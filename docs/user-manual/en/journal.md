# Journal Entries
How to log a trading day inside the Journal.

## Open a day
Route: `/journal/YYYY-MM-DD`
- Open the date from the calendar.
- If you trade multiple sessions in a day, record them in the same entry.

## Premarket Prep
- Write your bias, key levels, and planned setups.
- Note the main rule you want to respect today.

## During the session
- Register entries and exits.
- Add quick notes about emotions, execution, and rule breaks.

## Post-trade review

- Write one corrective action for tomorrow.

## Screenshots and evidence
- Attach charts or trade evidence when it helps explain the decision.
- Keep images focused on the exact setup or mistake.

## Best practices
